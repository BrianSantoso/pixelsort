Pixel sorting is a visual effect created by applying taking the rows, columns, or other set of pixels in an image and ordering them according to some value of those pixels, like how much red is in each pixel, their luminosity, hue, etc. It tends to create really cool visual effects, and it's mostly just for fun and artistic purposes.
